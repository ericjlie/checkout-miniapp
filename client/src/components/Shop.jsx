      <h3>Dear Beloved Friend,</h3>
        <div className='paragraph'>I know this message will come to you as a suprised
        but permit me of my desire to go into a buisness relationship with you.</div>
        <br/>
        <div className='paragraph'>My name is Eric Norton Lie, yes as you have suspected I am the 4th generation
        descendant of Josuha Abraham Norton better known to public as Norton I., Emperor of the United States.</div>
        <br/>
        <div className='paragraph'>I found your email by coincidence and am looking for a discreet buisness partner whom can assist in
        a mutually beneficial buisness arrangement.</div>
        <br/>
        <div className='paragraph'>Before his death my great grandfather deposited into the US Treasury
        the equivalent sum of <h4>USD 6, 260, 790</h4> in gold and silver. Unfortunately my current circumstances dictate
         that I must arrive at the US Treasury Building before December 18 at 6 in the morning or the funds
         will be requisitioned by the government.</div>
         <br/>
        <div className='paragraph'>My friend I am in urgent need. I offer you 20% of the sum <h4>USD 6, 260, 790</h4>
         once I have sold the metal in exchange for various small and whimsical trinkets. Please quickly press checkout on this website
         and transfer a small sum of USD 5,000 so I may purchase a BART ticket to Civic Center. I must go quickly so if no money is sent within 3 hours of receiving
         this communication I will send this offer to another.</div>
         <br/>
        <div className='paragraph'>Yours,</div>
        <br/>
        <div className='paragraph'>Eric Norton Lie, Emperor IV of the United States</div>
